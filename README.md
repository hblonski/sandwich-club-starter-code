# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

This is a fork from https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code. It was implemented as the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree project #1.

This app simply loads a JSON containing information from different sandwiches. The sandwiches are listed, and the user can select one of them to view the details.
